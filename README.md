## Introduction

In this project, we implement the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant features. The dataset is preprocessed and then fed into the clustering model, which groups the customers into a specified number of clusters. These clusters can then be analyzed to derive meaningful insights about different customer segments.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about customers, such as:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- (Add more features if applicable)

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for clustering.

## Installation
